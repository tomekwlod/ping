TODO:
- Tests
- Refactor repositories
- Refactor checker / ping command
- Security for the feeds
- Update this README with the Restful APIs examples 
- Fix insert/update defaults
- ensureIndex for mongodb
- introduce err.log

- if a page status is >= 300 (not 204 eg) then ignore the interval and check the ping every time the checker runs
- simple ping/curl pages are not enough. would be good to have the pages with the headers/post/etc params (eg. for the security, to check the db conn, etc)
+ GUI: instead of the Modified/Created dates do : last checked: X-mins ago
- if something is broken, send an email with the instructions (description) what to do to fix it!
- groups
- email should contain a /gui address and a status code
- if code 0 appears no clue what is happening...
- move everything to .env instead of having .env and configs/
