# ENV Settings::
# https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/4223

# env_file
# This file (or files) contains a list of docker environment variables which will be passed to the container as if they 
# were in the environment: block. These files are explicitly defined in the env_file: config block. Anything in these 
# files is passed as if it were via docker run --env-file=FILE.

# .env file (https://docs.docker.com/compose/env-file/)
# This file must be placed in the same directory where docker-compose is run from, and is automatically loaded by 
# docker-compose. It contains a list of environment variables which you would like to use as variable substitutions 
# (aka string replacement) within your docker-compose.yml. These vars are not passed to the docker container.
